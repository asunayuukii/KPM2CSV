# KPM2CSV
Kaspersky Password Manager 2 CSV

Own Version for Kaspersky Password Manager (KPM)
KPM export Passwords only to a TXT File.

To Import the Passwords to another Password Manager or Browser u need a .csv File.

This was a Fun Project for learning Scripting and improving my Skills.
I Have seen a Problem and an easy Solution.

If u have suggestions please let me know, im still interested to improve my skills and learn something new.

The Programm handle only Passwords and not Notes or Creditcards. Maybe i will add it later.
Anyway on Github u will find more professional Solutions for this Problem than my script.

But u can also use my solution it works on nordpass and chrome import
